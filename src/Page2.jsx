            Why We Made it?
        </h1>
        <p>
        We believe technology should empower people, not limit them. Many visually impaired individuals face daily challenges navigating unfamiliar spaces or locating essential items. Traditional mobility aids provide some assistance, but we saw an opportunity to take it further—blending artificial intelligence with real-world functionality. Our mission is to create a device that’s not just helpful, but truly life-changing. By combining smart object recognition, voice interaction, and obstacle detection, we are breaking barriers and opening doors to a more accessible world for all.
