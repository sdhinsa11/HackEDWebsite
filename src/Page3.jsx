            What Inspired us?
        </h1>
        <p>
        Our inspiration came from the millions of visually impaired individuals who navigate the world with resilience and determination. We saw the challenges they face daily—locating objects, avoiding obstacles, and moving independently in unfamiliar environments. We asked ourselves: How can technology bridge this gap and give them more freedom? Seeing how AI and smart sensors are transforming industries, we knew we could create something practical, empowering, and life-changing. Our goal was to move beyond traditional mobility aids and develop a device that doesn’t just assist but enhances independence and confidence.
